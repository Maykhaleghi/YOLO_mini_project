# Water Meter Reading Using YOLO and Streamlit

**Prepared by:** [@MayKhaleghi](https://github.com/MayKhaleghi) and [@AnooshaMohammadi](https://github.com/AnooshaMohammadi)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **automatic water meter reading** using **computer vision and deep learning**. A **YOLO-based object detection model** is trained to detect and recognize the numeric digits displayed on a water meter. To make the system user-friendly, a **Streamlit web interface** is developed, allowing users to upload an image of a water meter and instantly see the detected meter reading.

The goal of this project is to reduce manual meter reading, minimize human error, and provide a simple and accessible solution for automated water consumption monitoring.
